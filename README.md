                                                   Perhaps this project is under development, there may be inaccuracies in the work. 

As part of this project, a VPN service was developed that provides users with the ability to securely connect to remote servers using the L2TP/IPsec protocol. To ensure the confidentiality and security of transmitted data, a shared key is used, which makes the service a convenient and reliable tool for organizing secure access to the Internet.



WindowsForms technologies were chosen to create the graphical interface of the application, which made it possible to implement a user-friendly and intuitive design of the application. The interface allows the user to easily manage all the main functions of the application, including connecting, disconnecting, and monitoring the current connection status.



The connection and disconnection process is implemented using VBScript and Batch\scripts. VBScript is used to hide the launch of the batch file, which allows you to ensure a smoother and more transparent operation of the application for the user. Batch files, in turn, are responsible for performing all the necessary actions to establish a connection to servers, including passing connection parameters to.



To improve performance and ensure stable operation of the application, multithreaded programming has been implemented. This solution allowed you to perform multiple tasks simultaneously, minimizing delays and ensuring smooth interaction with the application even in high-load conditions.



Special attention in the project was paid to handling possible errors that may occur during the operation of the system. Mechanisms were provided for detecting and handling various failure scenarios, including connection problems, incorrect parameters, or unexpected server errors. These measures made it possible to increase the reliability of the program and provide the user with a comfortable experience with the application, minimizing possible system failures.


Cutting-Edge Techniques Employed in the Project:

Self-Made Libraries
Forget third-party packages – I’ve designed custom .lib and .dll libraries from scratch. These aren’t just reusable; they’re battle-tested for performance and precision, tailored specifically to the unique demands of this project.

Masterful Object-Oriented Design
Leveraging the full power of object-oriented programming, this project exhibits seamless integration of:

Inheritance: Reducing redundancy and maximizing code reuse across diverse components.
Encapsulation: Implementing robust security by safeguarding critical data with controlled access.
Polymorphism: Building systems that adapt dynamically to changing requirements.
Virtual Functions
With runtime polymorphism, I’ve enabled a level of modularity and extensibility that ensures the project remains scalable and adaptable to future expansions.

Dynamic Memory Allocation
Why settle for predefined boundaries? The system employs dynamic memory allocation to optimize resource usage, ensuring it operates at peak efficiency regardless of the workload.

Custom-Engineered Hash Tables
Forget generic key-value stores. I’ve implemented tailored hash tables with lightning-fast lookups and near-zero collisions, making data retrieval a marvel of computational efficiency.
